#MoxiePress

A simple but solid plugin for WordPress that does three things:

1. Creates a custom post type (for now defined as movies, with fixed custom fields)
2. Creates an API endpoint like /movies.json 
3. Produces a beautiful and fancy shortcode for WordPress that uses the API and can be activated on the front or other pages by inserting [moxie-press] in the content
